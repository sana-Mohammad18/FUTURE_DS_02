Internship

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing social media advertising campaign data to evaluate campaign effectiveness across different platforms and campaigns. The objective is to track key performance indicators (KPIs), understand marketing performance, and derive actionable insights that help optimize digital marketing strategies.

The analysis converts raw social media ad data into clear performance metrics and trends, enabling data-driven decisions related to budget allocation, audience targeting, and campaign optimization.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze overall campaign performance across platforms

Measure engagement and conversion efficiency

Compare performance between campaigns and platforms

Track time-based trends in spend, clicks, and conversions

Identify high-performing and underperforming campaigns

Support marketing optimization through data insights

📂 Dataset Description

Clicks

Spend (ad cost)

Conversions / leads

Revenue (if available)

Engagement metrics (likes, shares, comments)

Dataset sourced from publicly available social media advertising datasets.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Python

Pandas & NumPy – data cleaning and analysis

Matplotlib & Seaborn – visualization

Power BI – interactive dashboard creation

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

🔍 Methodology
